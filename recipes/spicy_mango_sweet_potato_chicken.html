    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a tropical tasting dish that is just as good vegetarian as it is with chicken! <br>
        Honey and mango lend the sauce it's sweetness, but it's nicely countered with salty tamari and spicy hot sauce. <br>
        Serve over rice or noodles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cubed peeled sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cubed</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons tamari soy sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons hot sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 ripe mango, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the sweet potatoes into a saucepan and fill with enough water to cover. <br>
            Simmer over medium-high heat until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
            Stir in chicken, and cook until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes; set aside. <br>
            Stir garlic into the skillet, and cook for a few minutes, until fragrant. <br>
            Pour in the tamari, 3/4 cup of water, honey, and hot sauce. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the sweet potato, <br>
            chicken, mango, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until hot. <br>
            Dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water, and stir into the simmering mixture; stir until thickened.</li>
    </ol>
